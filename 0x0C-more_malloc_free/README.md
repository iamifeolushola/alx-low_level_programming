# 0x0C. More malloc, free
This project was carried out during the **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX Africa School**. It aims to learn about how to use `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc` and `exit` functions in **C language**.

## More Info
* C files are compiled using `gcc 9.4.0`
* C files are written according to the `C90` standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04.0 LTS
