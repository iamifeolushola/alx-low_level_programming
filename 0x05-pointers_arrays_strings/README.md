# 0x05. Pointers, Arrays, Strings

This project aims to teach about pointers and arrays in **C Language**.

## Technologies
* C files were compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files were written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04.0 LTS

## Project Files
All of the following files are programmes written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [`0-reset_to_98.c`] (./0-reset_to_98.c) | Takes a pointer to an `int` as parameter and updates the value it points to `98` |
| [`1-swap.c`] (./1-swap.c) | Swaps the values of two integers |
| [`2-strlen.c`] (./2-strlen.c) | Returns the length of a string |
| [`3-puts.c`] (./3-puts.c) | Prints a string to `stdout` |
| [`4-print_rev.c`] (./4-print_rev.c) | Prints a string in reverse followed by a new line |
| [`5-rev_string.c`] (./5-rev_string.c) | Reverses a string |
| [`6-puts2.c`] (./6-puts2.c) | Prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character followed by a new line |
| [`7-puts_half.c`] (./7-puts_half.c) | Prints half of a string |
| [`8-print_array.c`] (./8-print_array.c) | Prints `n` elements of an array of integers followed by a new line |
| [`9-strcpy.c`] (./9-strcpy.c) | Copies the string pointed to by `src`, including the terminating null byte, to the buffer ppointed to by `dest` |
| [`100-atoi.c`] (./100-atoi.c) | Converts a string to an integer |
| [`101-keygen.c`] (./101-keygen.c) | Generates a random valid password for a program `101-crackme` |
