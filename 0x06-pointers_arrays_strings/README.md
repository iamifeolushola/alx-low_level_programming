# 0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings

This project explored more pointers, arrays, the differences, how to use them, the scope of variables, and manipulate strings.

## More Info
* All files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04.0 LTS using `gcc`.
* All script used the [`betty`](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki) style.
* All programs were written in C language according to `C90` standard.

## Files

All the following files are programmes written in C language:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [`0-strcat.c`](./0-strcat.c) | The program runs a function that concatenates two strings |
| [`1-strncat.c`](./1-strncat.c) | This program is a function that concatenates two strings and returns a pointer to the resulting string |
| [`2-strncpy.c`](./2-strncpy.c) | This program is a function that copies a string |
| [`3-strcmp.c`](./3-strcmp.c) | This program is a function that compares two strings |
| [`4-rev_array.c`](./4-rev_array.c) | This program reverses the content of an array of integers |
| [`5-string_toupper.c`](./5-string_toupper.c) | This program changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase |
| [`6-cap_string.c`](./6-cap_string.c) | This program is a function that capitalizes all words of a string |
| [`7-leet.c`](./7-leet.c) | This program is a function that encodes a string into 1337 |
| [`100-rot13.c`](./100-rot13) | This program is a function that encodes a string using rot13 |
| [`101-print_number.c`](./101-print_number.c) | This program is a function that prints an integer |
| [`102-magic.c`](./102-magic.c) | This required a line to [this code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/make_magic_happen/blob/master/magic.c) so that the program prints `a[2] = 98` followed by a new line |
| [`103-infinite_add.c`](./103-infinite_add.c) | This program is a function that adds two numbers, if the result cannot be stored in `r` the function returns `0` |
| [`104-print_buffer.c`](./104-print_buffer.c) | This program is a function that prints a buffer |
