# ALX Low-level programming & Algorithm

At ALX School, we learn by doing the hard things. This repository contains directories each corresponding to a **Low-level programming** and **algorithm** project. These projects are part of the School's 12-month curriculum.

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash 5.0.17(1)
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04.0 LTS
* C files are compiled using `gcc 9.4.0`
* C files are written according to the `C90` standard

## Projects

In these projects, we cover everything from the simplest code "Hello, world" in C to everything algorithm and data structure in low-level programming language C.

| Directory name | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| [`0x00-hello_world`](./0x00-hello_world) | It aimed to teach what is entry point, basic commands (puts, printf, putchar), compilation process with gcc in C language |
| [`0x01-variables_if_else_while`](./0x01-variables_if_else_while) | It aimed to teach about arithmetic operators, relational operators, boolean operators, comments, declaring variables and loops in C language |
| [`0x02-functions_nested_loops`](./0x02-functions_nested_loops) | It aimed to teach about header files, functions, loops and nested loops in **C language** |
| [`0x03-debugging`](./0x03-debugging) | It aimed to teach how to debug a script in C language |
| [`0x04-more_functions_nested_loops`](./0x04-more_functions_nested_loops) | It aimed to teach about nested loops in C language |
| [`0x05-pointers_arryas_strings`](./0x05-pointers_arrays_strings) | It aimed to teach more about pointers and arrays in C language |
| [`0x06-pointers_arrays_strings`](./0x06-pointers_arrays_strings) | It aimed to teach more about pointers and arrays in C language |
| [`0x07-pointers_arrays_strings`](./0x07-pointers_arrays_strings) | It aimed to teach even more about pointers and arrays in C language |
| [`0x08-recursion`](./0x08-recursion) | It aimed to teach about recursions, what they are, when and how to use them. |
