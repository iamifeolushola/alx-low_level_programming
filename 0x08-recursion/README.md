# Recursion

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX Africa School**. It aimed to teach about recursions and how to implement them in the **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the `C90` standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04.0 LTS

## Project Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [`0-puts_recursion.c`](./0-puts_recursion.c) | This program is a function that prints a string |
| [`1-print_rev_recursion.c`](./1-print_rev_recursion.c) | This program is a function that prints a string in reverse |
| [`2-strlen_recursion.c`](./2-strlen_recursion.c) | This program is a function that returns the length of a string |
| [`3-factorial.c`](./3-factorial.c) | This function returns the factorial of a given number |
| [`4-pow_recursion.c`](./4-pow_recursion.c) | This program is a function that returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y` |
| [`5-sqrt_recursion.c`](./5-sqrt_recursion.c) | This program is a function that returns the natural sqaure root of a number |
| [`6-is_prime_number.c`](./6-is_prime_number.c) | This program is a function that returns `1` if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return `0` |
| [`100-is_palindrome.c`](./100-is_palindrome.c) | This function returns `1` if a string is a palindrome and `0` if not |
| [`101-wildcmp.c`](./101-wildcmp.) | This program is a function that compares two strings and returns `1` if the strings can be considered identical. Otherwise, returns `0` |
